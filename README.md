# Data Mining Assignment on Naive Bayes
 It is a group project where we collect a dataset from Kaggle, then make some changes in the dataset so that it fits in Naive Bayes Algorithm. There the target variable was PurchaseIntent, like based on some feature to identify if a customer intents to buy a product or not. Using Naive Bayes we get 80.15% accuracy where test-train split was 70-30.
